- The latest version comes first.
- The release date of each version is displayed.
- Mention whether you follow Semantic Versioning.
#### Types of changes :
- `Added` for new features.
- `Changed` for changes in existing functionality.
- `Deprecated` for soon-to-be removed features.
- `Removed` for now removed features.
- `Fixed` for any bug fixes.
